Took the on-ramp to the information superhighway in '95 and my wardrobe and playlists haven't been updated since. I prefer to edit my files directly on the server. I miss Netscape, Yahoo (the real one) and websites without ads. I look forward to my next laptop more than my next car. Indiana Jones is my favorite super hero, and I think JAWS is the best film ever. I can re-watch any Godzilla movie, John Hughes flick or X-Files episode, anytime, anywhere.

I miss being called webmaster, but I don't mind being called the E-commerce Implementation Manager at (link: https://www.sideshow.com text: Sideshow), one of the coolest collectible companies on the planet. Been there almost 20 years, and as far as I'm concerned they can bury me in the parking lot in another 30 (fingers crossed).
