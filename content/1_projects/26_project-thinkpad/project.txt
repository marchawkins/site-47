Totally jumped on this (link: https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/ text: r/thinkpad ) bandwagon and picked up an old T440 (circa 2013) for $115. It had a little work done to it before I got it, but not much. Also came with the wrong charger and a missing TrackPoint (ie. "red nub"). Seller got that sorted out pretty quickly and I got to work.

**Starting specs: **
- Display: 14" 1366x768 LCD
- CPU: Intel Core i5
- RAM: 4gb
- Storage: 128gb HDD
- Trackpad: absolute shit

**New specs after the upgrades, and rough costs:**
- Display: 14" (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHXZKXFV text: 1920 x 1080 display) ($60)
- CPU: Intel Core i5
- RAM: (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVZMT7RT text: 12GB) ($25)
- Storage: (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y5VDNT9 text: 1tb SSD from PNY) ($60)

**And a few more upgrades:**
- New (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9M69NW8 text: CMOS battery and cable) ($7)
- New (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWIKXDJ text: keyboard with backlight) ($40)
- New proper (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076JF393L text: trackpad) ($25)
- Replacement (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06X1HZYDV text: red nub TrackPoint) ($5)
- Additional (link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DXD7GZV text: weird-ass charger) ($20)

**Notes:**
- I didn't realize 4GB was soldered to the board, so could only add one 8gb stick for a total of 12gb. Should be plenty for Linux though
- Charger uses some dumb proprietary connector, but luckily you can still find them cheap
- Trackpad replacement was tedious, but actually easy
- Keyboard replacement wasn't as bad as I thought it would be
- Screen replacement went ok, but the glue holding it together has to be peeled apart which was a huge pain in the ass. Constantly felt like I was going to break it.
- Was able to install Arch on it the first try. Very little tinkering to get things working.
- Only issue I can't figure out yet is getting the backlight on the keyboard to work. Could be hardware or software, or just user error.
