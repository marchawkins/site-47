Third installment of the Halloween Horrorfest - one horror movie every day for the month of October. Got to finally watch some more recent entries like Black Phone, Heretic and Weapons. Also some classics like Something Wicked This Way Comes and House of Wax. Don't even ask about Kenny & Company. I have no idea how that is "horror". Super slow 70s shiftiest.
