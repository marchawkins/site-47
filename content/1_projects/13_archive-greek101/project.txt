Text: An archive of various projects for a college screenprinting business, back in the early days of e-commerce websites, circa 1999-2000. Also some of the first HTML emails, which were super painful to create and test back then. Finally, a bunch of screen grabs from a line of freshman orientation CD-ROMs sent to incoming students at USC, Villanova, Northwestern and more. Those were a lot of fun, and I got to learn a ton about Macromedia Director (remember that? me neither.)
