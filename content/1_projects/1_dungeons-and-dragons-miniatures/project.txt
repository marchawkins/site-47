Text: Was finally able to find a group of friends to play D&D with, and we've been playing for almost 3 years (as of early 2024). Immediately after our first session, I got the itch to start painting miniatures for all our characters, which then snowballed into dozens and dozens of monsters, npc, accessories and more. Here are some shots of a good chunk of what I've painted so far. Hoping to continue posting more photos as I go, and someday paint all the ones I bought. But that will require me to stop buying more minis...
