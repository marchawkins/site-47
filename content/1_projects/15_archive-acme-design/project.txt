Text: Worked for a design shop outside Philadelphia in the early 2000s. Only about 5 of us, so I was the only "tech guy". Did a lot of flash work, as well as coding up online newsletters, websites, and my personal fav - a drag-and-drop slide editor in flash so the other people could make their own client presentations.
