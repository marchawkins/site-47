Text: Straight from The Pirates of the Caribbean, this 3D model (not mine, from (link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4861286 text: Thingiverse)) ran through the Creality Ender S1 Pro. Weathered and finished by me. Turned out pretty cool. Full disclosure, this is not a true replica as it has the same design on both sides. Good display piece, though.
