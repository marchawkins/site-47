Took the kids to the annual Pumpkinfest put on by (link: http://www.makotoway.com text: Makoto Martial Arts Studio). We always have a great time at this event - pie eating contest, chili cook-off, magicians, face painting, free beer, pumpkin catapults, tug-of-war and more. Did I mention the free beer?
