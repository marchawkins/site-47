Title: Wizards Game

----

Text: Took the family to a Wizards game at school. Like a modern day Harlem Globetrotters. The place was **packed** and rockin'. Couldn't hear yourself think. Carter loved it so much he had to get his photo with a bunch of players. Maddie also cheered at the event. Fun times!
