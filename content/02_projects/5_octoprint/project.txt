Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi with a Printrbot

Some old shots from when I setup (link: https://octoprint.org text: Octoprint) software on a (link: https://www.raspberrypi.org text: Raspberry Pi), used to control an original (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printrbot text: Printrbot) 3d printer. The printer hasn't been manufactured for years, so there's not much point in a detailed explanation of this project, but it was definitely a learning experience. The whole thing was a little flaky, but when it worked, it was pretty cool. Made for some nice time lapse video of longer 3d prints.
